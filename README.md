ddclient for your initramfs
===========================

This repository provides basic ddclient support for you initramfs.

It was only tested on Arch Linux and might need adjustment on other distributions (maybe look at libs added in files/lib/initcpio/install/ddclient). 

Also there is no IPv6 support yet
